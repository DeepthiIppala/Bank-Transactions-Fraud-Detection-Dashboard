## Project Overview
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze bank transaction data and identify fraud patterns. The report provides a clear view of transaction volume, transaction value, success and failure rates, and fraud-related activity across multiple dimensions.

I built this dashboard by following a guided tutorial and customizing it to better understand transaction behavior and fraud indicators using real-world style banking data.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
- Understand overall transaction activity
- Monitor transaction trends over time
- Identify failed and fraudulent transactions
- Analyze fraud patterns by transaction type, region, and network attributes
- Enable drill-down analysis for individual transactions

---

## Business Use Case
This dashboard can support:
- Operations teams monitoring transaction health
- Risk and fraud teams identifying suspicious activity
- Business users analyzing transaction trends and regional performance
